# rbw

This is a fork of [`rbw`](https://github.com/doy/rbw), an unofficial command
line client for [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/). Unlike the official
[command line client](https://help.bitwarden.com/article/cli/), which is
stateless and requires passing temporary keys around in environment
variables, `rbw` keeps the keys in memory in a background agent, similar to
`ssh-agent` or `gpg-agent`.

## Differences from upstream

* **Fewer dependencies.** A password manager is a high value target, and every
  crate it depends on increases the attack surface. This fork replaces many
  dependencies with small local implementations.
* **Convenience features.** `rbw tui` for browsing the vault interactively,
  `rbw show` for displaying an entry without its secrets, and a trash.

## Installation

The `rbw` packages of Linux distributions, Homebrew, Nix, etc, as well as
`cargo install rbw`, all install upstream `rbw`, not this fork. Build it from
a checkout of [this repository](https://github.com/neumannt/rbw) instead:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/neumannt/rbw
cd rbw
cargo install --locked --path .
```

This installs `rbw` and `rbw-agent` into `~/.cargo/bin`. At runtime, the
[`pinentry`](https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/pinentry/index.en.html)
program is needed to display password prompts, and copying to the clipboard
uses `wl-copy` (Wayland), `xclip` or `xsel` (X11), or `pbcopy` (macOS).

## Configuration

Configuration options are set using the `rbw config` command. Available
configuration options:

* `email`: The email address to use as the account name when logging into the
  Bitwarden server. Required.
* `sso_id`: The SSO organization ID. Defaults to regular login process if unset.
* `base_url`: The URL of the Bitwarden server to use. Defaults to the official
  server at `https://api.bitwarden.com/` if unset.
* `identity_url`: The URL of the Bitwarden identity server to use. If unset,
  will use the `/identity` path on the configured `base_url`, or
  `https://identity.bitwarden.com/` if no `base_url` is set.
* `ui_url`: The URL of the Bitwarden UI to use. If unset,
  will default to `https://vault.bitwarden.com/`.
* `notifications_url`: The URL of the Bitwarden notifications server to use.
  If unset, will use the `/notifications` path on the configured `base_url`,
  or `https://notifications.bitwarden.com/` if no `base_url` is set.
* `lock_timeout`: The number of seconds to keep the master keys in memory for
  before requiring the password to be entered again. Defaults to `3600` (one
  hour).
* `sync_interval`: `rbw` will automatically sync the database from the server
  at an interval of this many seconds, while the agent is running. Setting
  this value to `0` disables this behavior. Defaults to `3600` (one hour).
* `pinentry`: The
  [pinentry](https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/pinentry/index.html)
  executable to use. Defaults to `pinentry`.

### Profiles

`rbw` supports different configuration profiles, which can be switched
between by using the `RBW_PROFILE` environment variable. Setting it to a name
(for example, `RBW_PROFILE=work` or `RBW_PROFILE=personal`) can be used to
switch between several different vaults - each will use its own separate
configuration, local vault, and agent.

## Usage

Commands can generally be used directly, and will handle logging in or
unlocking as necessary. For instance, running `rbw ls` will run `rbw unlock` to
unlock the password database before generating the list of entries (but will
not attempt to log in to the server), `rbw sync` will automatically run `rbw
login` to log in to the server before downloading the password database (but
will not unlock the database), and `rbw add` will do both.

Logging into the server and unlocking the database will only be done as
necessary, so running `rbw login` when you are already logged in will do
nothing, and similarly for `rbw unlock`. If necessary, you can explicitly log
out by running `rbw purge`, and you can explicitly lock the database by running
`rbw lock` or `rbw stop-agent`.

`rbw help` can be used to get more information about the available
functionality.

Run `rbw get <name>` to get your passwords. If you also want to get the username
or the note associated, you can use the flag `--full`, or run `rbw show <name>`
to see everything except the password and other secrets (`rbw show -c <name>`
copies the password to the clipboard instead). You can also use the flag
`--field={field}` to get whatever default or custom field you want. The `--raw`
flag will show the output as JSON. In addition to matching against the name,
you can pass a UUID as the name to search for the entry with that id, or a
URL to search for an entry with a matching website entry.

### TUI

`rbw tui` opens an interactive browser for the vault, with fuzzy search as you
type. `Ctrl+P`, `Ctrl+U` and `Ctrl+T` copy the password, the username and the
TOTP code of the selected entry, and `F1` shows the other keys. Copied values
are cleared from the clipboard after 30 seconds, or when `rbw tui` exits.

*Note to users of the official Bitwarden server (at bitwarden.com)*: The
official server has a tendency to detect command line traffic as bot traffic
(see [this issue](https://github.com/bitwarden/cli/issues/383) for details). In
order to use `rbw` with the official Bitwarden server, you will need to first
run `rbw register` to register each device using `rbw` with the Bitwarden
server. This will prompt you for your personal API key which you can find using
the instructions [here](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/personal-api-key/).

### SSH Agent

`rbw-agent` includes a built-in SSH agent for signing SSH authentication
challenges directly. To use it, ensure that rbw is running (in order to make
it start handling ssh agent requests), and then point your SSH client to the
SSH agent socket:

```sh
rbw unlock
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/rbw/ssh-agent-socket"
```

If you're using a profile, the socket will be located at
`"XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/rbw-<profile>/ssh-agent-socket"`.

### 2FA support

`rbw` supports the following 2FA mechanisms :

* Email
* Authenticator App
* Yubico OTP security key (https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013712639-Testing-Yubico-OTP)

WebAuthn / Passkey and Duo security are unsupported 2FA mechanisms.

If you use only unsupported 2FA mechanism, you need to add a supported 2FA
mechanism on your bitwarden account to use rbw. It allows you to use rbw
with a supported mechanism, and use other clients with you preferred
2FA mechanism.
